At your funeral: / facebook quizzes, food photos / instagram sunsets
I lay close to her/ My arm rises with her breaths/ Too in love to sleep
though we do not talk / i draw your face on other girls / and avoid your eyes
The last drop of oil / will be burnt by a tank, in / a war over it
Little blond boy squats / Examining an ant hill / His bike sits, waiting
The pain is still there / though it is quieter now / it never leaves me
Does the flying bird / Say that it lives on the earth / Or in the blue sky
Self-immolation / Keeping everyone else warm / Burning yourself out

My gaze is transfixed / on the lights that shine below / as I soar higher
White chickweed flowers / Sound of hooves on soft earth near / abandoned deer bed
They ask for Dana / There's no Dana only Zuul / Who you gonna call?
remember all caps / when you spell the man's name / DOOM reigns supreme
Spring fawn in the brush / Still, mere yards from the pavement / Little miracle
waves of rain / dogen's words / down the roof of my hut
You never came back./It's felt like rain forever./You seemed happy here.
The man is tough nails / Dental chair reclines, "Open" / Trembling fawn on grass
smoky eyeshadow / lead me always to the bed / I love her eye cue
The end it would seem / So dreary, I can not stay / To read is to dream
What is existence/ A massive coincidence/ Or a master plan
Darkness cocoons/The shell breaks open once more/Butterflies emerge
We work and we play / Spend time to earn our money / What has more value?
Distant sound of bells / Ringing from the old temple; / No prayer has been called.
Death, be not afraid/Take me to another realm/My time will soon come
Haiku creative / or not, you had to think, I / made you create thought.
So far away now / From my old favorite place; / The moon is the same.
I only play bass/ So I can dry-hump and sing/ I can admit it
Cautious chartreuse ferns / Uncoil from curly brown beds / Of their forbearers
None in bowl or wipe / But I know there was a splash / Must be a ghost poop
Tired, exhausted / but we only get one life / get up and fight on
Pig-tailed energy, / flashes her gap toothed grin, shrieks, / and runs off again.
Sometimes I slip out/Walking through the cold night/And I think of you.
Broken promises / Lie tangled in the bed sheets / Never to be claimed
