I shed my old skin / It's not some deep metaphor; / I just have sunburn.
Lone Pokémon card / Abandoned at the bus stop / No-one chooses you
I am a haiku / Slave to form. Metered in verse / Briefly deep, then gone
At the end of life / the kings, the queens, and the pawns / are in the same box
I made space for you; / Cut out pieces so you'd fit. / You saw only holes
all of my nightmares/ came true because i believed/ in them more than dreams
