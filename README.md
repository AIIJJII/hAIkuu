Make sure you have both of these installed prior to running the code in this repo!
To start the server, simply do
```

Have fun!

## Notes
This is a reimplementation of a previous project created by Henry Du, Kelvin Liu, Shahn Shamdasani, and Andrew Sy.
The project originated as a hackathon hack at [HackHarvard2015](http://hackharvard2015.devpost.com/).
Check out the `hackharvard2015-save` branch to see what was demoed.
This reimplementation has heavier focus on the haiku generation algorithm.
