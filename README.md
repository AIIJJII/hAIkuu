## run it!
This repository contains everything you need (and then some) to get started!
The webapp is built with [Python](https://www.python.org/) and [Flask](http://flask.pocoo.org/).
Make sure you have both of these installed prior to running the code in this repo!
To start the server, simply do
```
$ ./runserver.py
```
from the root project directory.
Then, open a web browser and nagivate to `http://localhost:5000`.
Have fun!
